        "1. what is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "- Python is a programming lang that is easy to understand, write and famous among developers and programmers.\n",
        "- It is popular due indentation and minimal syntax making it easy to read and write.\n",
        "- It has 13k+ libraries to use, open-source, hude suport on forums and dev community. Dominance in AI and cross platforms\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "- It is nothing but the program that reads and executes python code line by line, translate high level code into machine readable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "- keywords are case sensitive, serves purpose as to control program, handling exceptions, logical operations, defining data structures etc\n",
        "- e.g. False, None, break, class, continue, def, elif, else, for, if, import, lambda, return, while etc\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "- Keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings in the language, and attempting to use them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "- Python uses keywords to recognize the structure of a program, and they are not allowed to be redefined or used for other purposes\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "- It Means objects state can be modified after its creation, we can change objects value or data directly without creating new objects\n",
        "e.g. List, dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "- Lists are mutable in Python because they are designed to support operations that modify their content after creation. This mutability allows for dynamic addition, removal, and modification of elements within the list.\n",
        "- Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable because they are intended to represent fixed collections of items. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "This immutability provides a guarantee that the data within the tuple will remain constant throughout its lifetim\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "- \"==\"  This operator checks if the values of two objects are equal. It compares the content or data held by the objects\n",
        "- \"is\" This operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. It verifies if they have the same memory address\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python\n",
        "- it is used to combine or modify conditional statements, evaluating either True or Fale.\n",
        "e.g. and, or, not\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python\n",
        "- it is process of changing variables data type.It enables you to convert values from one type to another.\n",
        "- Like input function always takes string as input, we need to type cast to int or float etc\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "- Implicit and explicit type casting, also known as type conversion, are mechanisms for converting a value from one data type to another. - - Implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler\n",
        "- while explicit type casting requires the programmer to define the conversion using specific syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
        "- It is used to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions are met. Control flow is controlled by conditional statements using dynamic inputs.\n",
        "- e.g. if, elif, else, while\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work\n",
        "- When if condition is false and control moved to next elif statement to check if condition is true or not. also used to check multiple elif conditions rather than more ifs\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "- For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items.\n",
        "- While loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements while a condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time\n",
        "- while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
